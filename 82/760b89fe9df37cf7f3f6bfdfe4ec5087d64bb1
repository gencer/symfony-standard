@weaverryan yes it makes sense to me. In a previous issue, @Pierstoval asked if we could add help notes in this file and I suggested to not do that. But I guess there is a sweet spot between adding nothing and adding a lot of documentation. I think your pull request is exactly that sweet spot. Thanks!

@javiereguiluz I agree - we don't want to maintain documentation on here. Thanks!

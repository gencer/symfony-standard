FirePHP should not break it as it uses a separate header for each log entry, so the header does not become too big. ChromePHP indeed makes the heade size grow as it uses a single header.

I think both handlers should __not__ be enabled by default because the feature should be opt-in and not opt-out.
Even if FirePHP does not break header size.

See the referenced issue. Only ChromePHP breaks without tuning the configuration of nginx. But I'm fine disabling both.

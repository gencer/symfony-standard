Are there enough cases where it needs to be adjusted per dev? I haven't had the requirement yet. So I don't see the need to include it by default.

Frontend developers always disable both of these things.

@kriswallsmith i think the naming `assetic_use_controller` would be better than `use_assetic_controller` - like `{section}_{option}`.

so we get:
```
    debug_toolbar:          true
    debug_redirects:        false
    assetic_use_controller: true
```

Iâ€™m doing this manually on my projects so would be great to see this in symfony-standard. :+1:

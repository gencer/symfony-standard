Test classes could be autoloaded only in a development environment by moving them from `src/AppBundle/Tests` to `tests` and adding a `autoload-dev` section in composer.
What do you think about this suggestion?

I agree with @gnugat here. Separating tests from the runtime source is a good idea IMO

this also requires an update of the HttpKernel component to change the location of the cache and logs

@gnugat @stof @fabpot is just making the structure match what was decided in #584 - so we should focus only on that (and open a new issue about tests for discussion).

Created #855 for tests

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Needs more work

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd recommend to merge #854 first.

Besides the new directory structure, I've made another change that should help: sessions are now stored outside of the `cache/` directory, and directly into the `var/` dir.

@fabpot Why is it better to store the sessions in `var` instead of `cache` ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2015-09-23T08:10:21Z

@Pierstoval Because clearing the session store should be decoupled from clearing the Symfony cache, the two are not related. And when using `cache:clear`, all the cache is flushed. Also, storing sessions in the cache has some problems with Windows (see symfony/symfony#15862 -- not confirmed though)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This one is ready for a last review before merge.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should `var/sessions/` not also have a `.gitkeep` and be added to the `.gitignore`?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2015-09-23T09:26:15Z

@michaelcullum right, fixed

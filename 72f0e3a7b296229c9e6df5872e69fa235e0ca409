It forces users to update their composer installation, and even if composer itself sends warnings, I don't know if it's a best practice.
But anyway I really like this feature :+1:

Given that it's included in a tagged release and that release is even more than a month old I am :+1: on this.

Please note that the Composer update warnings are no shown after 60 days instead of 30, maybe it's better to wait another month?

Oh did they exceed that value?

We already use `config.platform` from the same release as of https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard/commit/d0e9308e807aae02c332897d610ad5eb49d81c1e.

I think we can merge this now :+1:

That's very different. If config.platform is not taken into account, that's no big deal. Here, if script references are not supported, hooks do not work anymore.

I'm not sure I agree with this. Having both `symfony/symfony` **and** `symfony/var-dumper` should be something supported, as the first one contains the second one...

@Pierstoval having `symfony/symfony` *and* `symfony/var-dumper` as standalone vendor is not possible because `symfony/symfony` *replaces* `symfony/var-dumper` in composer.json. Note also that this PR isn't making this new so I don't get why you expressed a :-1: here.

I just don't get the *real* point of this, it seems to express an issue for users wanting to use `dump` *before* enabling `DebugBundle`, so in this case, it brings the feature "out of symfony", which can also be done by using `auto_prepend_file`'s php.ini config option, or by enabling the dumper manually in the Symfony's autoloader.

I think having this in symfony standard adds more complexity to the composer.json file for too specific cases, that's why I put a üëé , but still it's just an opinion üòâ

@Pierstoval the `Scenario #1` explained in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/20201 could be enough reason to enable this: it will allow to use `dump()` anywhere in your app. Besides, the "performance impact" is minimal because it's just one file.

I'm üëç

I don't really like this approach.
I prefer to install the var dumper globally. then I can **really** use it anywhere.

some people still use symfony on shared hosting, so this would be nice for them.  Perhaps flex will solve it somehow? perhaps some generator for helpful bits on shared hosting?

Can't we merge this one ? I thought it was already.
There no down side. Use a global install if you prefer @lyrixx, but asking everyone to know how to do it is asking for too much. The DX should be great by default without requiring people to learn yet another concept/option before they have the full setup.

The circle of the new icon looks a bit jagged. How does it look when displayed in a browser tab? Thanks!

Actually there *is* a slight difference but I don't know if it's a problem.

@Pierstoval thanks, but I wanted to see the icon in the browser tab at the mini-size the user will see. Here it is the comparison (top, current icon; bottom, new proposal):

I'd say that the new proposal is noticeable worse at small sizes :disappointed:

I've made a 32 color version - it's about 80% bigger, but still about 1/5 of the size of the original image (which has 600 colors in it)

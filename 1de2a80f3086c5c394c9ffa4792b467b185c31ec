:+1: What about 2.7 also?

@Pierstoval 2.7 is included too. This PR is for any Symfony version higher than 2.6.

This is not a bug fix, so surely it's not allowed into 2.6, and must go into 2.7+.

@GrahamCampbell Symfony SE works in a different way than Symfony. The versions reflect the Symfony version for which SE is tied with. Nobody upgrades its Symfony SE, it's just a starting point for new projects.

We're ready on the docs (a few spots still mention AcmeDemoBundle, but I don't think it's an issue). Can anyone think of any other side effects we haven't covered yet?

Regardless, :+1:

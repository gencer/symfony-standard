I would use single quotes. Single-quoted YAML scalars are simpler, because there are no special chars inside them (except the single quote itself)

@stof done (I've also replaced all existing double quotes by single quotes for the sake of consistency).

Shouldn't this be done in 2.7 instead?

Why not, but the deprecation is triggered only since 3.3.

Replacing existing quotes should indeed be done in 2.7, to make merging branches easier

* Switched to 2.7
* Uniformized indentation (no align)
* Unifomized comments

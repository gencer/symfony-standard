I would change it to ``path/to/project`` if youo think that ``path/to/symfony/app`` is confusing because of the ``app`` folder, because it is not the path to symfony (Symfony is in the ``vendor/symfony/symfony`` subfolder)

Good point! The fix was meant to remove confusion, not to replace it with other confusion ;)

I've used dashes (in stead of slashes) to better separate the part the user should replace from the location of the configuration script.

Maybe `http://localhost/path-to-project-web-folder/config.php` is even better, because the `web` folder is usually configured as document root.
But it may also over-complicate the example.

Doesn't this also come back in point 3? That just points to "web/app_dev.php/demo/hello/Fabien"

Yes, another reason I think we should stick with `http://localhost/path-to-project/web/config.php`.

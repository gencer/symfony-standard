I wonder how this interacts with https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard/blob/2.8/app/autoload.php#L6 that is part of the bootstrapping?

@Tobion I think this line should be specific to entry points (`app.php`, `app_dev.php` and `console`) and not the autoloader :confused:

@nicolas-grekas do you agree with this PR? And shouldn't we add symfony/phpunit-bridge to the require-dev section as well?

LGTM Yes. Adjoint the bridge is a good idea although not strictly required since it looks like that no deprecations are triggered for now

I just tested it with phpunit and the php config is executed before AND after the `bootstrap` file. So the error_reporting is -1 when calling autoload and is reset to -1 after it by phpunit. But it is not set for each test. This is strange behavior by phpunit. But at the end it doesn't really matter to us. There is no difference if error reporting is `-1` or `-1 & ~E_USER_DEPRECATED` if you use the phpunit bridge.

So this is good to be merged.

For the phpunit-bridge I created #884

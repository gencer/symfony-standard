``~2.11.3`` is indeed a bad constraint as it forbids getting the latest releases.

I would even migrate to 3.0.2+ to have the new features.

The same issue happens when using 3.0.1+ (I haven't tested on 3.0.2 yet, will do so shortly).
So if you want to migrate to 3.x, it needs to be locked on 3.0.0 for the time being

It should work, atleast for the changelog.. is reverting the change that was causing the issue

I've tested with 3.0.2 and it works fine, I have updated the PR to use 3.0.2+

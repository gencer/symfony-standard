adding back the bundles is easy, but shouldn't a note be left to mention why this was done? and to point people where to the bundles? Something like this:

```
NOTE: The Standard Edition previously contained bundles that were licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
LIST BUNDLES AND LINKS HERE
 These bundles were removed due to incompatibility with the popular (L)GPL 2 licenses. If you do not require
any libraries that are licensed under (L)GPL 2 then you are free to install them.
```

If @jdorn chooses lgpl 3  for sql-formatter then we run into another gpl 2 incompatibility with the profilerbundle. If he chooses lgpl 2 it will be incompatible with swiftmailer

What's the problem with the ProfilerBundle?

I don't mind changing SqlFormatter to MIT.  Will that fix any issues?  I knew absolutely nothing about licenses when I first picked one to go with.

Do I need to include a LICENSE.txt file or something in the project in addition to stating it in composer.json?

Generally it's wise to include a license.txt file as a lowest common denominator.

I'm out of town at the moment but I'd be happy to chat with you next week in irc if you want. I used to be the Drupal Association director  of legal affairs so I have some experience groking and explaining license compatibility and documentation.

Thank you @fabpot !

@jdorn: changing it to MIT would simplify things for many people.

FYI, it has been changed

@jdorn could you tag your release ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by jdorn at 2013-04-27T15:03:21Z

I just tagged it v1.2.9

ok, we now have only MIT/BSD license deps for Symfony SE.

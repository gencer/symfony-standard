@Tobion thanks for reporting this error! You are absolutely right and I've just updated the file.

You should then also include ``@other_service_name`` with double quotes.

@xabbuh Why? It's not necessary.

@Tobion I added the quotes suggested by @xabbuh before reading your comment. Even if they are not mandatory, do you think it would be a good idea to add them for consistency reaons? Or do you think it's better to not include them?

By the way, I switched "other_service_name" by "another_service_name". It sounds better than me, but please tell me what you think. Thanks!

@Tobion The ``@`` is reserved in YAML for future uses. Of course, it's not necessary here, to be parsed properly. But that also applies to the percent sign. So, let's be consistent here.

Then you would also need to put `class: AppBundle\Directory\ClassName` in quotes which makes everything harder to read.

The backslash has no special meaning outside double quoted strings. Even worse, "\D" and "\C" are no valid escape sequences, so the backslash would need to be escaped.

I was referring to the "consistency" javier was talking about. `"plain_value"` vs `AppBundle\Directory\ClassName`

Then I misunderstood you.

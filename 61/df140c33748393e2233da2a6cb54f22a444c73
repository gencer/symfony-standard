Docs need updating too as they still refer to the old ``assets_version``:
http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/framework.html#ref-framework-assets-version

Perhaps, mentioning [assets version bundle](https://github.com/kachkaev/KachkaevAssetsVersionBundle) there will be useful too.

Should be merged in 2.7 as that is where this config has been deprecated. But this will conflict currently as `assets` config in SE has not been added there yet.

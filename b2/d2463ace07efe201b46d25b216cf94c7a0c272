Please change the order of the directories to be the same as in 2.7 to ease merging: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard/blob/2.7/app/phpunit.xml.dist

and please update the code coverage whitelist too (take it from the 2.7 branch too)

@stof the code coverage whitelist is already up to date I guess, isn't?

Is there still any code changes needed or everything is fine?

What about this:

```diff
-/var/*
-!/var/cache
/var/cache/*
!var/cache/.gitkeep
-!/var/logs
/var/logs/*
!var/logs/.gitkeep
-!/var/sessions
/var/sessions/*
!var/sessions/.gitkeep
+/var/*
!var/SymfonyRequirements.php
```

Could it work by moving `/var/*` at the end of the file? I don't know if Git takes the order in account :confused: It could be a bit better-looking..

I tried your example just to be sure...but it doesn't work and exclude the whole `/var/` dir.

It's strange that simply removing the `!/var/sessions` and alikes does not work :confused:
Indeed it's ugly, but it makes me wonder of how `.gitignore` *really* works...

why do you need to keep specific files or folders? these are generated automatically if they are missing. I have some projects for a long time with this config. it work's without problems.

I think itâ€™s good idea to check in the directories to avoid permission issues. Will check the PR later today.

the whole var folder should be writable by the web server. it should be no problem to create the missing files and folders.

@DavidBadura The var/bootstrap.php.cache should probably not be writable by the web server.

We save the thumbnails, uploads etc. in that folder, which in turn is stored by the webserver. Instead of inserting all folders and files into the gitignore-file, we should consider removing the files that shouldn't be ignored from the var folder. This is only about 'var/bootstrap.php.cache' - right?

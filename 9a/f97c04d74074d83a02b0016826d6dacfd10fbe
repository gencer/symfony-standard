Which tools do you want to comply with?

Sorry about that, I added a description.

With the explanation, I find this legit and I'd say :+1:

@taylankasap you can change the commit message with `git commit --amend -m 'New message'` and push your changes with `--force`. I noticed you commited your changes to the master branch. Next time it might be worth to create a new branch so that you don't pollute your master.

Okay, I've updated the commit message.

:+1: Should be merged in 2.3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should I send a new pull request from 2.3 to 2.3? I'm not familiar with the pull request flow.

@taylankasap this is just a suggestion to the person who'll be doing the merge. You don't have to do anything at this point.
